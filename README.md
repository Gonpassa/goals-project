# GOALS
#### Video Demo: <URL here>
#### Description:

The objective is to create a web application where one can record the goals they have. 
The application will encourage the use of tools that are based on the science of setting & achieving goals to assist the user in achieving his/her goals.
The tools used will be based on the research analyzed by Andrew Huberman on episode 55 of his podcast. 

### Tools 
1: Use Focal Vision to Initiate Goal Pursuit
Focusing vision on one point externally and fixing it there for 30-60 sec increases focus/drive to persue goals. 
Implementation - Timer with a dot in the center of the page or something not hard to look at at. User will look at image for 30-60 sec. 

2:Use Aged Self-Images to Self-Motivate
People will persue goals more if they see themseleves aged to the time of the deadline for the goal. 
eg - I want to have graduate in 4 years. Users that visualize themselves mentally in 4 years will be less effective at persuing their goals in contrast to users that 
saw themselves in reality aged by four years by a computer program. 
Implementation - Application asks to use camera, user takes selfie, program ages picture according to the the dealing of their goal. 

3: Visualization of achieveing goal is only helpful at goal setting. 
Visualization of achievement is helpful to set goals, but bad at motivation for the continued persuit of the goal. 
Implementation- When prompting users for goals, require them to first visualize them achieving the goal they desire.

4: Visualizing Failure is the Best Ongoing Motivator
Visualizing failure will encourage goal persuit.
Implementation - When users decide to persue goals, one task will be to write one to two sentences of what it will mean to fail at achieveing that goal, or
have them type that when they first are submitting their goals and simply have a reminder of it when they decide to persue the goal. 

5: Make goals moderately Lofty
Best goals are those that are not too easy and not too hard. 
Implementation - When users input their goal, first remind them of this fact. To encourage tough but achievable goals.
